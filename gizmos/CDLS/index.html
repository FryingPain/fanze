<h1>CDLS Archive</h1>
<p>CDLS (Cringe de la semana) is a now cancelled spanish series running 2021-2022 i made that was originally for a Discord friend. It's theme is showing cringe content that people have made, and make jokes about it (like a failed YTP). It is cancelled because i deemed it's pointless to continue, since i only show this to one friend, plus it was wasting the time, so i am creating this archive to show you some episodes. Episodes 3, 5, 7, 8 and 9 are currently lost media.</p>
