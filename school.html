    <h1>My experience with my previous school</h1>
    <p>Over the past few years, I've been on the same school, until 2023, where i switched school. It was a very nice school, where i met friends, some still in contact to this day, but i had to abandon that school.<br>Why is that you may ask? Well, it begins at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
    <p>Everything stated here is from my own and personal experience, i wont include incidents that happened to others because believe me, it also happened and way worse.</p>
    <h1>2020</h1>
    <h2>The pandemic</h2>
    <p>At early 2020, classes were cut due to the virus spreading in my country. As a result, our school implemented the famous online classes system.<br>This was the first cause of chaos.</p>
    <h1>2021</h1>
    <h2>The pandemic: Phase 2</h2>
    <p>Classes were still cancelled, and this year was online classes as well.<br>Over the course of these 2 years of online classes, my classmates behavior started to worsen, due to them forgetting the values and going through puberty.</p>
    <p>I've been also showing an interest in furries, which would develop into me being a furry, my fursona was a green Protogen. This state was the recipe of disaster.</p>
    <p>By the end of the year, a few classmates starting going to physical school.</p>
    <h1>2022</h1>
    <h2>The chaos</h2>
    <p>My classmates, after 2 years without interaction to people, and their hormones reaching peak limits, started showing their real side when they arrived school.</p>
    <p>A certain classmate noticed i am a furry, and started to disapprove me, hating speech, my best friend also did the same. It really hurted me, because of my preferences. No need to say i was also being bullied online for this.</p>
    <p>Then a classmate thought i was flirting with his girlfriend. I was in no way flirting with her, we both wee just good friends, all i did was just normal friends stuff like hugging.</p>
    <p>I had a talk with the "principal" about the previous student bullying me for being a furry. To me, he sounded like "it's better to not be a furry cause they're weird". After that, i completely quit my fursona and being a furry. Now seeing them makes me uneasy and mad.</p>
    <p>My teacher also threatened me to leave a negative note for banging the table in a moment of brief frustration. I have Asperger's syndrome, although i do believe my actions in that moment were disrespectful, i also believe i should have been treated nicely instead of threat and anger.<br>It felt like that my teacher unleashed all the anger she had with my classmates bad behavior on me, which in comparison to them, I'm very nice.<br>I am still scared of her to this day, and from what i was told, she became more tedious.</p>
    <p>Then the kid who thought i was flirting with his gf started to say a few stuff on my back. It wasn't any bad stuff, but it was the last straw for me in my opinion.</p>
    <h1>2023</h1>
    <h2>The aftermath</h2>
    <p>On September 2022 i quit my school. I didnt go to school for the rest of the year. I am now in another school, and you wont believe how happy i have become in comparison to last year.</p>
    <p>My friend also switched to this school, and now another friend who had been targeted for severe bullying is considering to switch to my school as well.</p>
    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Thanks previous school for making me meet new friends and have great moments, but you have unfortunately changed and not for the better. It is sad to see that a school i was in since 2nd grade make this bad move.</p>
