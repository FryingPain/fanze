<h1>Index of papá_files</h1><p>My previous school computers all have a Windows.old containing the same downloads folder before they all got wiped & upgraded to Windows 10.<br>I have managed to save the folder before i got out of my school. This was on June 2022.<br>Now, here's some of the stuff found on my previous school old downloads folder.<br><b>Everything here is 100% legit found on the downloads folder except index.html, which is this page. Everything else is found there, including the Steven Universe one.</b><br>Some sensitive stuff, such as direct references to 18+ stuff, the school name, & unimportant stuff has been excluded from being hosted & shown on this page due to privacy/security/website size reasons.</p>
